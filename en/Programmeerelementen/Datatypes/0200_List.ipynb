        "netflix = \"History. Netflix was founded in 1997 in Scotts Valley, California by Marc Randolph and Reed Hastings. Hastings came up with the idea to start the company, after he had to pay a fine of 40 dollars for returning the rented film Apollo 13 late. The Netflix website went online on April 14, 1998, with 30 employees and 925 videos for rent. Four years later, the company was listed on the NASDAQ technology exchange. Initially, Netflix's business model was based on renting DVDs indefinitely, which were sent by mail in distinctive red envelopes. As soon as one returned the DVD, Netflix sent the next DVD from the list of reserved movies. The number of DVDs one could have at the same time depended on the subscription type. With increasing broadband penetration, Netflix made the switch to streaming. In January 2019, the company also joined the Motion Picture Association (MPA). International. Netflix was only active in the United States until September 22, 2010, but after that, servers also went online in Canada and it became an international company. In September 2011, it also became active in Latin America. On January 9, 2012, the company started in Europe, in Ireland and the United Kingdom. Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland followed in October 2012. On September 11, 2013, Netflix launched its SVOD (subscription video on demand) in the Netherlands. The offer consists from the beginning of both Dutch and foreign films, series, documentaries, concerts, and cabaret. All foreign content will in principle have subtitles, with the exception of programs for young children on the Netflix Kids channel, which are dubbed. Content for older children and teenagers will usually be subtitled, with sometimes also the choice for dubbing. On September 19, 2014, Netflix was launched in Belgium, with a similar offer for Flanders as in the Netherlands. On March 24, 2015, Netflix was launched in Australia and New Zealand and Japan was added on September 2. In Spain, Portugal, and Italy, Netflix became available on October 20, 21, and 22, 2015, respectively. On January 6, 2016, Reed Hastings announced at the CES technology fair in Las Vegas that as of this day, Netflix will be available in 130 additional countries. As a result, Netflix is available worldwide except in the People's Republic of China, where Netflix is still working, and countries and regions subject to American sanctions such as North Korea, the Crimea peninsula and Syria. However, in most of the new countries, only Netflix's own content is offered.\""
