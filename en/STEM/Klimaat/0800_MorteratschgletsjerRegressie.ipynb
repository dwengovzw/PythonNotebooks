Since 1880, the average global temperature has risen by approximately 0.85 \u00b0C. This warming is accompanied by the warming of the oceans, a rise in sea level by 20 cm, more frequent extreme weather conditions, and a 40% decrease in Arctic sea ice. Additionally, glacier ice is melting almost everywhere in the world.<br><br>",
