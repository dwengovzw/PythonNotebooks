    "Since the industrial revolution, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has steadily increased. Since 1880, the average global temperature has risen by about 0.85 °C. This warming is accompanied by a warming of the oceans, a sea level rise of 20 cm, the increasing occurrence of extreme weather conditions, and a 40% decrease in Arctic sea ice. Glacier ice is also melting, almost everywhere in the world.<br><br>The meltwater originating from mountain glaciers will significantly determine how much the sea level will rise in the future. Possible scenarios speak of an increase of up to 30 cm due to the melting of the mountain glaciers. <br>Moreover, glaciers have an impact on local water supplies and are important for tourism.<br>The rate at which the volume of a glacier decreases due to global temperature rise varies from glacier to glacier. Local factors indeed play a role in this: e.g., the orientation of the glacier, the extent to which the glacier lies in the shade ... [1]."
