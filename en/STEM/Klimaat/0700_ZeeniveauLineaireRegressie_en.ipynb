In the Netherlands, the average sea level between low and high tide is taken: the Normal Amsterdam Level (NAP). The TAW reference point is 2.33 meters below the NAP reference point. To compare national height measurements with each other, the different reference points must be taken into account [2].<br><br>**Sea level is expressed in mm RLR (Revised Local Reference); data relative to the local reference are converted to data relative to the international reference level.**"
